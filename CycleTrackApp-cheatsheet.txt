CycleTrackApp Cheat Sheet
========================

1. Making Code Changes
----------------------
- If you change any code (frontend, backend, UI, etc.), open a Command Prompt in your project folder and run:
  npm run build
- This will rebuild your app so changes show up in the browser or Electron.

2. Running the App (Development)
-------------------------------
- To run in the browser (for testing web version):
  Double-click start-broswer-dev.bat
- To run in Electron with hot reload (for testing desktop version):
  Double-click start-CycleSense-dev.bat
- To run the Electron app in production mode (no hot reload):
  Double-click start-CycleSense.bat
  (Make sure to run npm run build first if you changed code!)

3. Building a Portable EXE (for Distribution)
---------------------------------------------
- To create a new portable Windows .exe for sharing:
  Double-click MakePortableExe.bat
- The new EXE will be in the 'dist' folder.
- Don't commit the 'dist' folder to git (it's already in .gitignore).

4. Copying Changes from CycleTrack2
-----------------------------------
- You can copy code changes from CycleTrack2 (the web-only version) into this project.
- Only copy files that are not Electron-specific (don't overwrite main.cjs or Electron config files).
- If you add new dependencies, also add them to package.json and run npm install.
-----------------
- Build app after making changes:         npm run build
- Run browser dev server:                 start-broswer-dev.bat
- Run Electron dev (hot reload):          start-CycleSense-dev.bat
- Run Electron prod (no reload):          start-CycleSense.bat
- Build portable EXE for distribution:    MakePortableExe.bat
- Run browser prod (with build):          start-broswer-prod.bat
- Run browser prod (NO build):            start-broswer-prod-nobuild.bat  [requires manual npm run build first]
- Run Pi prod (with build):               start-pi-prod.sh
- Run Pi prod (NO build):                 start-pi-prod-nobuild.sh  [requires manual npm run build first]

5. Common Problems
------------------
- If you see errors about missing Node.js or npm, install them from https://nodejs.org
- If you see errors about missing dependencies, run:
  npm install

(You can keep or print this file for reference.)

`Main.js`, `Main.cjs`, `package.json`, `splash.html` are all Electron files.
